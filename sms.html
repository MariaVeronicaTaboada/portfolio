        <h2>Glimpse of the Institution</h2>

        <p>
          The Sisters of Mary congregation was founded by
          <abbr title="Venerable">Ven</abbr>. Aloysuis Schwartz, an American
          diocesan priest, to provide medical care to the sick and dying,
          shelter to the homeless, and most especially education to the
          underpriviledged children/youth.
        </p>

        <p>
          <abbr title="Venerable">Ven</abbr>.
          <abbr title="Aloysuis">Al</abbr> first established the Sisters of Mary
          School in Busan, South Korea to alleviate the sufferings of the
          Koreans due to the Korean War.
        </p>

        <p>
          After estsblishing Boystown and Girlstown in Korea, Fr. Al then
          continued his mission to the Philippines and to Mexico. Mexico was his
          so called Unfinished Symphony since it wasn't done yet when he died.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, his death was not the hindrance for his mission to be
          stopped. The Religious Congregation of the Sisters of Mary and
          Brothers of Christ continued Fr. Al's works. His work continued to
          expand from Korea, Philippines, and Mexico, to Guatemala, Brazil,
          Honduras and recently in Tanzania, Africa.
